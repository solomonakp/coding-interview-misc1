  /**
   * Create a deep copy of a dictionary such that all of the origina keys are maintained
   * and copied into a new dictionary.
   *
   * This is used when we have to create a copy of a dictionary to prevent concurrent mutation
   * or when we need to copy it and then make changes to the new dictionary.
   *
   * The values in the map could be arrays, other dictionaries, sets, maps, strings, arrays, etc.
   *
   * Make sure to handle all cases.
   *
   * This needs to be fully recursive including dictionaries contain other dictionaries
   * and arrays.
   *
   * HINTS
   *
   * - To test if a variable is an object:
   *
   * typeof val === 'object'
   *
   * - To test if a variable is an array:
   *
   * Array.isArray(object)
   *
   * - To get all the keys of an object you can call Object.keys(dict)
   *
   * - If you are given an array as input it should return an array as output.
   *
   * - If you are given an object as input it should return an object as output.
