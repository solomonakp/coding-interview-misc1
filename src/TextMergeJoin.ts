/**
 * In our app we have regions of text that may or not be contiguous.
 *
 * The text is given back as rectangles with x, y, width, and height properties.
 *
 * If the x, y, width, and height are close enough, we can assume they're the same word.
 *
 * Sometimes our rectangles are word fragments NOT the whole word so we need to join the words
 * again to form entire sentences.
 *
 * The test data has examples of what these partial regions would look like.
