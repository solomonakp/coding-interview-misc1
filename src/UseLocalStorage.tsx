/**
 * Implement a replacement for useState which keeps values in the localStorage.
 *
 * The idea here is that all calls to use useState can be replaced with
 * useLocalStorageState(key, initialValue) and implement the same behavior.
 *
 * The first time useLocalStorageState is called the value will be initialValue
 * because nothing is stored in localStorage.
 *
 * Each time the user calls the setter (similar to useState) we need to trigger
 * component re-render and save the updated value in localStorage.
 *
 * The next time we are called we should use the value from localStorage.
 *
 * We should support the following values stored in localStorage:
 *
 * string, number, object, array
 *
 * Note that we're using GitHub gists here because there's no compiler.  Please
 * make sure your code is fully formed, no edge case, clean, etc.
 *
 * We're not worried about small issues like imports. The main issue is that the
 * code is free of bugs and high quality.
 *
 * @param key The key should be the key used by localStorage
 * @param initialValue The initial value to store for the first value.
